# Quick Start

Three commands to start analysing your metagenome data:
```
    conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge metagenome-atlas
    atlas init --db-dir databases path/to/fastq/files
    atlas run
```
All databases and dependencies are installed on the fly in the directory `db-dir`.
You want to run these three commands on the example_data on the GitHub repo.
If you have more time, then we recommend you configure atlas according to your needs.
  - check the `samples.tsv`
  - edit the `config.yaml`
  - run atlas on any cluster system
For more details see [documentation](https://metagenome-atlas.rtfd.io/).

# Assembly based metagenomics

Atlas is a easy to use metagenomic pipeline

![scheme of workflow](resources/images/ATLAS_scheme.png?raw=true)


## Install the development version from GitHub
Atlas is still under active development; therefore, you may want to install the up to date atlas from GitHub. Atlas should be run on _linux_, the assembly works also on OS X, but unfortunately not the tools used for binning.
[![Snakemake](https://img.shields.io/badge/snakemake-â‰¥5.4.5-brightgreen.svg)](https://snakemake.bitbucket.io)

Create a conda environment with all primary dependencies. All further dependencies are installed on the fly.
```
conda create -n atlas -c bioconda -c conda-forge python=3.6 snakemake pandas bbmap=37.78 click=7 ruamel.yaml biopython
```
Load the environment:
```
source activate atlas
```
copy code from GitHub and install:
```
git clone https://github.com/metagenome-atlas/atlas.git
cd atlas
pip install --editable .
```
Now you should be able to run atlas:
```
atlas init --db-dir databases path/to/fastq/files
atlas run
```
