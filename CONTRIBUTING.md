# Submit a bug report

*First look in the all open and closed issues for the error message you got.*

As atlas is based on snakemake, check if you find a similar bug already discussed for other snakemake-workflows. 

If you don't find any help. Submit a issue: 

- specify the system you are working on: linux, cluster, shared filesystem? 
- copy the error message
- add the log file of the rule, wich produced the error.
- If you run the atlas on a cluster join also the log file of the cluster.

I hope we can help you...
